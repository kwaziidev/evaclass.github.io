<p>We spent a day in the country and picked a lot of flowers. Our car was full of flowers inside! On the way home we had to stop at traffic lights , and there my wife saw the bookshelf. It stood outside a furniture (家具)shop. &ldquo;Buy it,&rdquo; she said at once. &ldquo;Well carry it home on the roof-rack (车顶架) . Ive always wanted one like that . &quot;</p>
<p>What could I do? Ten minutes later I was twenty dollars poorer, and the bookshelf was tied on to the roof-rack. It was tall and narrow, quite heavy too . As it was getting darker, I drove slowly . Other drivers seemed more polite than usual that evening. The police even stopped traffic to let us through . Carrying furniture was a good idea. After a time my wife said, &ldquo;Theres a long line of cars behind . Why dont they overtake (超车) ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that time a police car did overtake. The two officers (警官)inside looked at us seriously when they went past . But then , with a kind smile they asked us to follow their car through the busy traffic. The police car stopped at our village church (教堂) . One of the offices came to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sir, &quot; he said. &ldquo;Do you need any more help now?&ldquo;I didnt quite understand . &ldquo;Thanks, officer, &quot; I said . &ldquo;Youve been very kind. I lived just down the road. &quot; He was looking at our things: first at the flowers, then at the bookshelf. &ldquo;Well, Well, &quot; he said and laughed . &ldquo;Its a bookshelf youve got there ! We thought it was-er, something else . &quot; My wife began to laugh . Suddenly I understood why the police drove here . I smiled at the officer. &ldquo;Yes, its a bookshelf, but thanks again.&rdquo; I drove home as fast as I could .</p>
